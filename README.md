# Titanic Classification 🚢🔍

Predict the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=test.csv). It consists of two files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`, containing information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Tools Used
- 🐼 Pandas
- 📊 Matplotlib
- 📈 Seaborn
- 🛠️ Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-classification.git
```

2. Open and run the "titanic_classification.ipynb" notebook in Colab Notebook to execute the Python code cells and train the predictive model.

3. Explore the analysis, visualizations, and predictive model to understand the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.

## Analysis and Preprocessing
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values in columns like 'Age' and 'Fare'.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore relationships between variables using visualizations like histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering**: Create new features like 'family_size' based on the number of family members aboard.
- 📊 **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
- 🔄 **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Building and Evaluation
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**: Train a decision tree classifier on the training data.
- 📈 **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy score on the test data.
- 🎯 **Predictions**: Make predictions on the test dataset and generate a submission file for Kaggle competition.

## 📊 Visualization
The analysis includes various visualizations such as histograms, box plots, pie charts, and scatter plots to explore relationships and patterns in the data.
